Description: This package allows a user to simulate a Monty Hall game from the game show
"Let's Make a Deal". The game consists of three doors, one with a car behind it and two with goats.
A player starts the game by selecting a door which then prompts the host to reveal a goat 
behind one of the two remaining doors. Players then have the option to stay with their original
choice or switch doors. This package contains functions to create a new game by randomly assigning
prizes to doors, select a door, reveal a goat, stay or switch doors and determine the outcome of the game. These 
are bundled together so a user can run a simulation and determine the best strategy for winning.
